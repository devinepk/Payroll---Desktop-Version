# About
This is a desktop version of [EasyPayRoll](https://github.com/devinepk/EasyPayRoll), a Powershell script for solopreneurs to quickly and easily run their payroll. This was built using Windows Forms.  I want to become more familiar with c#, so it's a fancier version of the Powershell program linked earlier.

## How to run this program (in progress)
1. Locate the Payroll.exe here: Payroll\bin\Release\
2. Enter your email address in the Sender Email field
3. Use the date picker to select the start and end of the pay period
4. Enter the employee/contractor information.
	a. Extra = any performance bonus
5. Click Add Row
6. Verify the information is correct in the grid, then click Send Email.

## TODO
- Ability to delete row from grid.
- If email exists in grid, update the existing record.
- Add icon for executable.
